## Team Info

## Project Description

Our project will be a card game called Macau, similar to Uno except it utilizes a standard 52 card deck rather than a special Uno deck of cards. See the rules below and enjoy!

## How to Launch

Compile the Woo file and the game will start.

## Rules
- Players are given six cards from a standard 52 card deck. The first player to go can put down any card.
- After the first turn, the other player can put down a card that is either the same suit or the same number as the previous card played.
- There are three card numbers with special functions:
  - The 2 card forces the other player to draw 2 cards and skip their turn.
  - The 4 card functions the same as two, except it forces the player to draw four instead of two cards.
  - The ace card forces the other player to skip a turn.
- The game will end when either player runs out of cards in their hand. That player will be the winner.
- You will always have the first turn
- At the start of your turn, your hand will be shown to you, with your cards read in a line.
- The card that you drew most recently will always be the leftmost card.
